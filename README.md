# WIP Real time Offer logger for Mesos

A Mesos scheduler to launch using Marathon that shows every offer that is being launched in a Mesos cluster and expose them in a web view.

The idea is to build from ground a debugging tool to help in the diagnose of errors while developing Mesos frameworks, executors or simply running tasks.
